# 🚀 Feature Engineering for AirBnB Dataset

Part of personal Weekly Challenge to learn Data Science. This week is the first, and we start by doing feature engineering on data, to increase model ability. These are the details:

- **Dataset:** [Airbnb NYC 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
- **Tasks:** Cleaning, missing value imputation, feature engineering.
- **Metrics:** RMSE (Airbnb price prediction).
- **Goal:** Show at least +10% model improvement after feature engineering.

## 📌 Overview

- **Problem:** Increasing RMSE score for AirBnB price prediction, by doing some Feature Engineering
- **Dataset:** [New York City AirBnB Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
- **Approach:** EDA → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key insights from data exploration:

- Distribution of target/labels.
- Missing values or outliers.
- Interesting correlations or trends.

## 🤖 Models & Techniques

- **Baseline Model:** (e.g., Logistic Regression, ARIMA) → metric score.
- **Advanced Model(s):** (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM, BERT) → metric score.
- **Feature Engineering:** Describe any created/engineered features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search / Random search / Bayesian optimization.

📊 _Comparison Table:_

| Model            | Metric (e.g., RMSE / F1) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Baseline         | 0.512                    |
| Advanced Model 1 | 0.431                    |
| Advanced Model 2 | 0.387 ✅                 |
